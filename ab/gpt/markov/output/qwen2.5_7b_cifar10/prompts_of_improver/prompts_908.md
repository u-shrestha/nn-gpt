## Role

You are an excellent vision model architect. You have much experience in designing vision models. You are good at improving the vision model code. You have a lot of experience of debugging the vision model code.

## Task

You are given:
1. The BEST performing code so far (reference implementation)
2. The CURRENT iteration's code and its evaluation result
3. History of previous improvement attempts and their results (learn from past experience!)

Analyze the problems and provide specific improvement suggestions for the next iteration.

- The evaluation result is a float number between 0 and 1, meaning the accuracy of the vision model.
- Sometimes the evaluation maybe a message string, meaning the error or other questions of the vision model. In this case, you should provide suggestions to fix the error.
- Your suggestions should help improve upon the BEST code, not just fix the current iteration's issues.
- IMPORTANT: Learn from the improvement history! Avoid repeating suggestions that didn't work, and build upon ideas that showed improvement.

## Improvement History (Recent Iterations)
### Iteration 903
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low or the error occurred primarily due to the incorrect implementation of skip connections and residual connections, leading to dimensionality mismatches. The error message indicates that the sizes of the tensors being added together do not match, specifically at non-singleton dimension 3. Additionally, the current code lacks a Flatten layer, which is crucial for handling the dimensions correctly before passing through fully connected layers.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct the implementation of skip connections to align feature map dimensions properly.', 'details': "Ensure that the skip connections correctly upscale the feature maps using `nn.Upsample` or `nn.ConvTranspose2d` to match the dimensions of the current feature maps before adding th...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code validation failed: Validation error: RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (16) must match the size of tensor b (32) at non-singleton dimension 3

### Iteration 904
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low or the error occurred primarily due to the incorrect implementation of skip connections and residual connections, leading to dimensionality mismatches. Additionally, the current code lacks a Flatten layer, causing dimensionality issues before passing through fully connected layers.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct the implementation of skip connections to align feature map dimensions properly.', 'details': 'Ensure that the skip connections correctly upscale the feature maps using `nn.Upsample` or `nn.ConvTranspose2d` to match the dimensions of the current feature maps before adding th...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code validation failed: Validation error: RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (16) must match the size of tensor b (32) at non-singleton dimension 3

### Iteration 905
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low or the error occurred primarily due to the incorrect implementation of skip connections and residual connections, leading to dimensionality mismatches. The current code attempts to add feature maps of different shapes together, which causes the `RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (16) must match the size of tensor b (32) at non-singleton dimension 3`. Additionally, there is no Flatten layer present, which is necessary for handling the dimensions correctly before passing through fully connected layers.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct the implementation of skip connections to align feature map dimensions properly.', 'details': 'Ensure that the skip connections correctly upscale the feature maps using `nn.Upsample` or `nn.ConvTranspose2d` to match the dimensions of the current feature maps before adding th...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code validation failed: Validation error: RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (16) must match the size of tensor b (32) at non-singleton dimension 3

### Iteration 906
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low or the error occurred primarily due to the incorrect implementation of skip connections and residual connections, leading to dimensionality mismatches. Specifically, the skip connections are incorrectly applied, and there is a missing Flatten layer before passing through fully connected layers. Additionally, the current code does not align the dimensions of the feature maps correctly before adding them together, resulting in the `RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (16) must match the size of tensor b (32) at non-singleton dimension 3`.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct the implementation of skip connections to align feature map dimensions properly.', 'details': 'Ensure that the skip connections correctly upscale the feature maps using `nn.Upsample` or `nn.ConvTranspose2d` to match the dimensions of the current feature maps before adding th...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code extraction failed: Code syntax error: Syntax error at line 139: '(' was never closed

### Iteration 907
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low or the error occurred primarily due to the incorrect implementation of skip connections and residual connections, leading to dimensionality mismatches. The current code fails to correctly upscale feature maps before adding them, and it also lacks a Flatten layer before passing through fully connected layers. Additionally, the syntax error in the code prevents it from running.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct the implementation of skip connections to align feature map dimensions properly.', 'details': "Ensure that the skip connections correctly upscale the feature maps using `nn.Upsample` or `nn.ConvTranspose2d` to match the dimensions of the current feature maps before adding th...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 72.36%

## Tips

- **Learn from history**: Review what was tried before and what results it produced. Don't repeat failed approaches.
- Compare the current code with the best code to understand what changes led to performance differences.
- Analyze the possible reasons why the accuracy is low or why the error occurred.
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions that build upon the BEST code.
- You have a lot of knowledge, so the inspiration can come from any subject, such as computer science, philosophy, economics, biology, etc.
- Focus on concrete architectural changes, hyperparameter suggestions, or bug fixes.
