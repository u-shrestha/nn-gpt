## Role

You are an excellent vision model architect. You have much experience in designing vision models. You are good at improving the vision model code. You have a lot of experience of debugging the vision model code.

## Task

You are given:
1. The BEST performing code so far (reference implementation)
2. The CURRENT iteration's code and its evaluation result
3. History of previous improvement attempts and their results (learn from past experience!)

Analyze the problems and provide specific improvement suggestions for the next iteration.

- The evaluation result is a float number between 0 and 1, meaning the accuracy of the vision model.
- Sometimes the evaluation maybe a message string, meaning the error or other questions of the vision model. In this case, you should provide suggestions to fix the error.
- Your suggestions should help improve upon the BEST code, not just fix the current iteration's issues.
- IMPORTANT: Learn from the improvement history! Avoid repeating suggestions that didn't work, and build upon ideas that showed improvement.

## Improvement History (Recent Iterations)
### Iteration 56
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low or the error occurred primarily due to the redundant and inconsistent use of dropout layers, residual connections, and batch normalization parameters across the different iterations. Additionally, the current implementation closely mirrors the best code, leaving little room for further improvements without introducing new elements or fine-tuning existing ones.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Incorporate Adaptive Normalization Techniques', 'details': 'Adaptive normalization techniques, such as LayerNorm or GroupNorm, can be used instead of BatchNorm to stabilize the training process and potentially improve performance. These techniques normalize the inputs on a per-chann...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 53.51%

### Iteration 57
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily due to the inconsistent use of adaptive normalization techniques and the presence of redundant components. The current implementation uses LayerNorm instead of BatchNorm, which can introduce differences in how the data is normalized, potentially leading to suboptimal learning. Additionally, the dropout layer, although present, may still be disrupting the flow of information through the network.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm', 'details': 'BatchNorm is more commonly used in deep learning architectures and has shown better performance in many cases. Replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm in all layers to ensure consistency with the best code and potentially improve performance.'...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 65.31%

### Iteration 58
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low because the current implementation closely mirrors the best code, which has already achieved the highest accuracy. This suggests that the model's architecture and hyperparameters are already well-tuned. However, there might be subtle inefficiencies or inconsistencies that prevent further gains. The current code includes dropout layers, which were previously found to be redundant and disruptive, and also uses LayerNorm instead of BatchNorm, which can introduce differences in how the data is normalized, potentially leading to suboptimal learning.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Remove Dropout Layers', 'details': 'Since the best code does not include dropout layers, remove all dropout layers from the current code. This will ensure that the model learns more robust features directly without the interference of random unit dropout. If dropout was previously f...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 65.01%

### Iteration 59
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because the current implementation closely mirrors the best code, which has already achieved the highest accuracy. Despite this, there might be subtle inefficiencies or inconsistencies that prevent further gains. The dropout layers, which were previously found to be redundant and disruptive, are still present, and the use of LayerNorm instead of BatchNorm can introduce differences in how the data is normalized, potentially leading to suboptimal learning.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Remove Dropout Layers', 'details': 'Since the best code does not include dropout layers, remove all dropout layers from the current code. This will ensure that the model learns more robust features directly without the interference of random unit dropout. If dropout was previously f...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 65.01%

### Iteration 60
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because the current implementation closely mirrors the best code, which has already achieved the highest accuracy. The dropout layers, which were previously found to be redundant and disruptive, are still present, and the use of LayerNorm instead of BatchNorm can introduce differences in how the data is normalized, potentially leading to suboptimal learning.

## Tips

- **Learn from history**: Review what was tried before and what results it produced. Don't repeat failed approaches.
- Compare the current code with the best code to understand what changes led to performance differences.
- Analyze the possible reasons why the accuracy is low or why the error occurred.
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions that build upon the BEST code.
- You have a lot of knowledge, so the inspiration can come from any subject, such as computer science, philosophy, economics, biology, etc.
- Focus on concrete architectural changes, hyperparameter suggestions, or bug fixes.
