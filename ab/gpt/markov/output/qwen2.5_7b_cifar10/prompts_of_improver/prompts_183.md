## Role

You are an excellent vision model architect. You have much experience in designing vision models. You are good at improving the vision model code. You have a lot of experience of debugging the vision model code.

## Task

You are given:
1. The BEST performing code so far (reference implementation)
2. The CURRENT iteration's code and its evaluation result
3. History of previous improvement attempts and their results (learn from past experience!)

Analyze the problems and provide specific improvement suggestions for the next iteration.

- The evaluation result is a float number between 0 and 1, meaning the accuracy of the vision model.
- Sometimes the evaluation maybe a message string, meaning the error or other questions of the vision model. In this case, you should provide suggestions to fix the error.
- Your suggestions should help improve upon the BEST code, not just fix the current iteration's issues.
- IMPORTANT: Learn from the improvement history! Avoid repeating suggestions that didn't work, and build upon ideas that showed improvement.

## Improvement History (Recent Iterations)
### Iteration 178
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily due to the larger kernel sizes used in the attention mechanisms and inconsistent padding settings. These changes can alter the receptive field and feature extraction process, leading to a loss of finer details and potentially affecting the overall performance. Additionally, the current implementation introduces slight variations in the architecture compared to the best code, which may contribute to the performance gap.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Consistent Kernel Sizes and Padding', 'details': 'Ensure that all convolutional layers use consistent kernel sizes and padding settings. Specifically, use a padding of 1 for all convolutions to maintain consistent spatial dimensions. This will help in maintaining uniform feature map...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 69.51%

### Iteration 179
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily due to the inconsistent use of kernel sizes and padding settings in the convolutional layers, as well as the attention mechanisms. Additionally, the current implementation introduces larger kernel sizes and different padding settings compared to the best code, which can lead to a loss of finer details and altered feature extraction processes. These changes can negatively impact the overall performance of the model.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Consistent Kernel Sizes and Padding', 'details': 'Ensure that all convolutional layers use consistent kernel sizes and padding settings. Specifically, use a padding of 1 for all convolutions to maintain consistent spatial dimensions. This will help in maintaining uniform feature map...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 69.51%

### Iteration 180
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because the current implementation uses larger kernel sizes in the convolutional and attention mechanisms, which can lead to a loss of finer details. Additionally, the padding settings are inconsistent across different layers, which can affect the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. These changes can negatively impact the overall performance of the model.

- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 69.51%

### Iteration 181
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because the current implementation uses larger kernel sizes in the attention mechanisms and inconsistent padding settings compared to the best code. This can lead to a loss of finer details and altered feature extraction processes, negatively impacting the overall performance of the model.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Consistent Kernel Sizes and Padding', 'details': 'Ensure that all convolutional layers use consistent kernel sizes and padding settings. Specifically, use a padding of 1 for all convolutions to maintain consistent spatial dimensions. This will help in maintaining uniform feature map...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code validation failed: Validation error: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'

### Iteration 182
- **Problem identified**: The error occurred due to a missing operation in the `forward` method, specifically the `self.pool4(self.silu4(self.bn4(self.conv4(x))))` line. Additionally, the accuracy is low because the current implementation introduces additional residual connections and skip connections that were not present in the best code, which might be causing issues with the feature flow and model stability.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Remove Unnecessary Skip Connections', 'details': 'Remove the `self.skip1`, `self.skip2`, `self.skip3`, and `self.skip4` layers as they introduce unnecessary complexity and may disrupt the feature flow. The best code does not have these layers, and removing them can simplify the mode...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 67.93%

## Tips

- **Learn from history**: Review what was tried before and what results it produced. Don't repeat failed approaches.
- Compare the current code with the best code to understand what changes led to performance differences.
- Analyze the possible reasons why the accuracy is low or why the error occurred.
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions that build upon the BEST code.
- You have a lot of knowledge, so the inspiration can come from any subject, such as computer science, philosophy, economics, biology, etc.
- Focus on concrete architectural changes, hyperparameter suggestions, or bug fixes.
