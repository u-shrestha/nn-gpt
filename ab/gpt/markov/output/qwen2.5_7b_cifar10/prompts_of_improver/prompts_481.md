## Role

You are an excellent vision model architect. You have much experience in designing vision models. You are good at improving the vision model code. You have a lot of experience of debugging the vision model code.

## Task

You are given:
1. The BEST performing code so far (reference implementation)
2. The CURRENT iteration's code and its evaluation result
3. History of previous improvement attempts and their results (learn from past experience!)

Analyze the problems and provide specific improvement suggestions for the next iteration.

- The evaluation result is a float number between 0 and 1, meaning the accuracy of the vision model.
- Sometimes the evaluation maybe a message string, meaning the error or other questions of the vision model. In this case, you should provide suggestions to fix the error.
- Your suggestions should help improve upon the BEST code, not just fix the current iteration's issues.
- IMPORTANT: Learn from the improvement history! Avoid repeating suggestions that didn't work, and build upon ideas that showed improvement.

## Improvement History (Recent Iterations)
### Iteration 476
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because the current implementation closely mirrors the best code but may still lack certain key elements that contribute to higher performance. Specifically, the current code introduces additional spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) and dropout layers, which are not implemented correctly, leading to an AttributeError during the forward pass. Additionally, the current implementation has redundant components and inconsistencies, which may affect the model's ability to generalize well.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct Spatial Pyramid Pooling Implementation', 'details': 'Ensure that the SPP layers are correctly implemented and integrated into the forward pass. Specifically, make sure that the SPP layers output the correct shape before being used in subsequent operations. For example, the o...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code validation failed: Validation error: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'

### Iteration 477
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily due to the inconsistency in the application of dropout layers and the addition of redundant and incorrectly implemented dropout layers. The error occurred due to a `NoneType` object having no attribute 'shape', indicating a potential issue with the forward pass where a tensor is expected to have a shape but does not.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Remove Redundant Dropout Layers', 'details': 'Remove the dropout layers that are applied inconsistently and do not add value to the model. Specifically, remove `dropout4`, `dropout5`, and possibly others if they are not necessary. Ensure that only critical dropout layers are kept, w...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code extraction failed: Code syntax error: Syntax error at line 140: invalid syntax

### Iteration 478
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because the current implementation closely mirrors the best code but may still lack certain key elements that contribute to higher performance. Specifically, the current code introduces additional spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) and dropout layers, which are not implemented correctly, leading to errors during the forward pass. Additionally, the current implementation has redundant components and inconsistencies, which may affect the model's ability to generalize well.

Specifically, make sure that the SPP layers output the correct shape before being used in subsequent operations. For example, the S...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 57.78%

### Iteration 479
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because the current implementation closely mirrors the best code but may still lack certain key elements that contribute to higher performance. Specifically, the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) layers are not integrated correctly into the forward pass, leading to errors. Additionally, the current implementation has redundant components and inconsistencies, which may affect the model's ability to generalize well. The inconsistent application of dropout layers and incorrect handling of tensor shapes also contribute to the low accuracy.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct Spatial Pyramid Pooling Implementation', 'details': 'Ensure that the SPP layers are correctly implemented and integrated into the forward pass. Specifically, use AdaptiveAvgPool2d to extract features from different spatial scales and then concatenate these features to form t...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code validation failed: Validation error: RuntimeError: Given groups=1, weight of size [192, 193, 1, 1], expected input[2, 384, 4, 4] to have 193 channels, but got 384 channels instead

### Iteration 480
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low and the error occurred primarily due to the incorrect integration of the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layers and the incorrect handling of tensor shapes. The current implementation attempts to concatenate SPP outputs with residual connections, but the dimensions do not match, leading to a runtime error. Additionally, the inconsistent application of dropout layers and the redundant components further contribute to the low accuracy and errors.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct Tensor Shape Handling', 'details': 'Ensure that the tensor shapes are consistent across all operations. Specifically, modify the concatenation step to handle the correct number of input channels. For instance, the current implementation tries to concatenate SPP outputs with ...

## Feedback from Evaluator
Code validation failed: Validation error: RuntimeError: Given groups=1, weight of size [192, 193, 1, 1], expected input[2, 384, 4, 4] to have 193 channels, but got 384 channels instead

## Tips

- **Learn from history**: Review what was tried before and what results it produced. Don't repeat failed approaches.
- Compare the current code with the best code to understand what changes led to performance differences.
- Analyze the possible reasons why the accuracy is low or why the error occurred.
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions that build upon the BEST code.
- You have a lot of knowledge, so the inspiration can come from any subject, such as computer science, philosophy, economics, biology, etc.
- Focus on concrete architectural changes, hyperparameter suggestions, or bug fixes.
