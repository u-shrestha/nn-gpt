## Role

You are an excellent vision model architect. You have much experience in designing vision models. You are good at improving the vision model code. You have a lot of experience of debugging the vision model code.

## Task

You are given:
1. The BEST performing code so far (reference implementation)
2. The CURRENT iteration's code and its evaluation result
3. History of previous improvement attempts and their results (learn from past experience!)

Analyze the problems and provide specific improvement suggestions for the next iteration.

- The evaluation result is a float number between 0 and 1, meaning the accuracy of the vision model.
- Sometimes the evaluation maybe a message string, meaning the error or other questions of the vision model. In this case, you should provide suggestions to fix the error.
- Your suggestions should help improve upon the BEST code, not just fix the current iteration's issues.
- IMPORTANT: Learn from the improvement history! Avoid repeating suggestions that didn't work, and build upon ideas that showed improvement.

## Improvement History (Recent Iterations)
### Iteration 1092
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because the current implementation uses bias=False in the fully connected layers, which is different from the best code. Additionally, the order of operations within the forward pass is slightly different, which may disrupt the flow of information and effective learning. The use of SiLU in the final fully connected layer is consistent with the best code, but the placement of residual connections and attention mechanisms is still incorrect.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct the placement of residual connections and attention mechanisms', 'details': 'Ensure that residual connections are applied before the attention mechanisms, as shown in the best code. Specifically, in the forward pass, the residual connection should be added before the attenti...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 71.10%

### Iteration 1093
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because the current implementation uses `bias=False` in the fully connected layers, which differs from the best code. Additionally, the placement of residual connections and attention mechanisms is slightly off, and the order of operations within the forward pass is not exactly the same as in the best code. These factors may disrupt the flow of information and effective learning, leading to lower accuracy.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct the bias setting in fully connected layers', 'details': 'Change the bias parameter in the fully connected layers (`fc1` and `fc2`) to `bias=True`, as shown in the best code. This ensures that the model can learn more complex relationships in the data.'}, {'suggestion': 'Alig...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 72.38%

### Iteration 1094
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is currently at 72.38%, which is already close to the best code's accuracy of 72.38%. However, there might still be subtle differences in the architecture, activation functions, or hyperparameters that could further improve the model's performance.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Ensure consistency in the use of activation functions', 'details': 'Double-check that all activation functions used in the current code match those in the best code. Ensure that `SiLU` is used consistently throughout, including in the final fully connected layer, and that `GELU` is ...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 71.66%

### Iteration 1095
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because there are slight differences in the batch normalization parameters and the forward pass order. Additionally, the momentum values for batch normalization are set to 0.99 instead of 0.9, and the epsilon values are set to 1e-5 instead of 1e-4. These small differences might contribute to suboptimal performance. The forward pass order and the use of SiLU activations are consistent, but there is room for optimization.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Adjust batch normalization parameters', 'details': 'Set the momentum parameter in batch normalization layers to 0.9 and the epsilon parameter to 1e-4. This aligns the current code with the best code and helps ensure consistency in the training process.'}, {'suggestion': 'Optimize fo...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 72.38%

### Iteration 1096
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is currently at 72.38%, which is already very close to the best code's accuracy of 72.38%. However, the forward pass order and some minor architectural details might still contribute to slight performance differences. Additionally, the current implementation maintains consistency in activation functions but there is room for optimizing the batch normalization parameters and ensuring precise alignment with the best code.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Adjust batch normalization parameters to match the best code', 'details': 'Set the momentum parameter in all batch normalization layers to 0.9 and the epsilon parameter to 1e-4. This ensures that the current code closely aligns with the best code in terms of normalization behavior.'...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 72.38%

## Tips

- **Learn from history**: Review what was tried before and what results it produced. Don't repeat failed approaches.
- Compare the current code with the best code to understand what changes led to performance differences.
- Analyze the possible reasons why the accuracy is low or why the error occurred.
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions that build upon the BEST code.
- You have a lot of knowledge, so the inspiration can come from any subject, such as computer science, philosophy, economics, biology, etc.
- Focus on concrete architectural changes, hyperparameter suggestions, or bug fixes.
