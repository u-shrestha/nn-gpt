## Role

You are an excellent vision model architect. You have much experience in designing vision models. You are good at improving the vision model code. You have a lot of experience of debugging the vision model code.

## Task

You are given:
1. The BEST performing code so far (reference implementation)
2. The CURRENT iteration's code and its evaluation result
3. History of previous improvement attempts and their results (learn from past experience!)

Analyze the problems and provide specific improvement suggestions for the next iteration.

- The evaluation result is a float number between 0 and 1, meaning the accuracy of the vision model.
- Sometimes the evaluation maybe a message string, meaning the error or other questions of the vision model. In this case, you should provide suggestions to fix the error.
- Your suggestions should help improve upon the BEST code, not just fix the current iteration's issues.
- IMPORTANT: Learn from the improvement history! Avoid repeating suggestions that didn't work, and build upon ideas that showed improvement.

## Improvement History (Recent Iterations)
### Iteration 366
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low or the error occurred primarily due to incorrect handling of 2D tensors in the attention mechanisms and the subsequent flattening operations. The error message indicates a mismatch in the channel dimensions during the application of the convolution operation in the attention mechanisms.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct the Attention Mechanism Handling', 'details': 'Modify the attention mechanisms to correctly handle 2D tensors. Instead of flattening the tensor and then applying the attention mechanism, directly apply the attention mechanism to the 2D tensor. This will ensure that the tenso...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 71.85%

### Iteration 367
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy remains at 71.85%, which is the same as the best code. This suggests that the current architecture and hyperparameters are well-tuned, but there may be subtle improvements that can be made. The main issues identified previously were related to attention mechanism handling and channel management. These areas need further refinement to ensure optimal performance.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Optimize Attention Mechanisms', 'details': 'Enhance the attention mechanisms by incorporating multi-head attention and ensuring consistent handling of 2D tensors. Specifically, modify the attention mechanisms to avoid flattening the tensors and instead apply the attention mechanism ...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 69.89%

### Iteration 368
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because the current implementation of the attention mechanisms is not consistent with the best code. Specifically, the current implementation uses an incorrect approach for handling 2D tensors, leading to errors and suboptimal performance. Additionally, the current code lacks some of the refinements found in the best code, such as multi-head attention and proper residual connections.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Implement Multi-Head Attention', 'details': 'Introduce multi-head attention to the attention mechanisms. This involves splitting the input into multiple heads and processing each head separately before concatenating the results. This can help the model focus on different aspects of ...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code validation failed: Validation error: AttributeError: 'Net' object has no attribute 'g'

### Iteration 369
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low or the error occurred primarily due to incorrect handling of 2D tensors in the multi-head attention mechanisms and the subsequent operations. The current implementation attempts to apply multi-head attention directly to 2D tensors, which requires reshaping and permuting the tensors. This leads to dimension mismatches and errors. Additionally, the current code lacks certain components present in the best code, such as residual connections and consistent activation functions.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Consistent Tensor Handling', 'details': 'Ensure that all 2D tensors are consistently handled. Instead of permuting and reshaping tensors, apply multi-head attention directly to the 2D tensors. This will simplify the code and reduce the risk of dimension mismatches. For example, use ...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code validation failed: Validation error: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'

### Iteration 370
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because the current implementation of the multi-head attention mechanisms is not properly integrated into the 2D tensor flow. This leads to dimension mismatches and errors, such as the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'`. Additionally, the current code lacks residual connections and consistent activation functions, which are key components in the best-performing code.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Integrate Residual Connections', 'details': 'Ensure that all convolutional layers are followed by residual connections. This will help maintain the information flow through the network and prevent the vanishing gradient problem. For example, after each convolutional layer, add a res...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code validation failed: Validation error: AssertionError: query should be unbatched 2D or batched 3D tensor but received 4-D query tensor

## Tips

- **Learn from history**: Review what was tried before and what results it produced. Don't repeat failed approaches.
- Compare the current code with the best code to understand what changes led to performance differences.
- Analyze the possible reasons why the accuracy is low or why the error occurred.
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions that build upon the BEST code.
- You have a lot of knowledge, so the inspiration can come from any subject, such as computer science, philosophy, economics, biology, etc.
- Focus on concrete architectural changes, hyperparameter suggestions, or bug fixes.
