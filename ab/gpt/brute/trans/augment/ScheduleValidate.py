"""
A schedule config is a JSON-style list of segments:
    [[method, alpha, fraction], ...]
where `fraction` is the FRACTION OF THE TRAINING EPOCH (applied in order,
must sum to exactly 1.0) — NOT a probability. `alpha` semantics per method
are documented in METHODS below. Cutout-style sizes are FRACTION OF IMAGE
SIDE (0..1), never pixels.

Every component (config generator, batch applicator, evaluator, prompts)
must agree with this file. If you change METHODS here, update the prompt
JSONs in the same commit.
